TLDR: I analyzed AirBnB data in Lisbon, its impact on the housing market and the dramatic effect the COVID-19 quarantine had on 

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>

Isn't it funny how we all love to travel but hate tourists? 

The explosion in tourism in Portugal and its role in economic recovery has been documented... extensively. As such it is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, I'm more interested in the side effects. 

AirBnB started as an 'original' idea of two roommates placing an extra mattress in the living room. Otherwise known as monetizing [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) (which started way back in 2003). As it grew in popularity, ambition quickly followed and they have now achieved 'disruption' of much more than the hotel industry. In the case of Lisbon, the number of AirBnB have reached epic proportions.

We can see Lisbon tops the chart in number of listings by citizen. Also 80% of listings are for entire apartments and 77% are available for more than 3 months. So much for that extra couch in the living room or the occasional weekend away. 

Another way to visualize it is in a map (of course).

It's not all bad. To connect this project with one of my previous posts, the fact of the matter is that many old, rotten buildings in historical areas have been rehabilitated. Here for example we can see the number of construction permits issued rising as the number of AirBnBs also increase. We can't deny that our city is looking sharp. The only problem is we can't afford it.
