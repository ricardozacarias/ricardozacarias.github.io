TLDR: I explore the evolution of AirBnB in Lisbon, its impact on the housing market and the effects of quarantine on the short-stay trade.

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>

Isn't it funny how we all love to travel but dislike tourists? 

AirBnB started as an 'original' idea of two roommates placing an extra mattress in the living room, otherwise known as monetizing [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/), which started way back in 2003. As it grew in popularity, ambition quickly followed and they have now achieved 'disruption' of much more than the hospitality industry. In Lisbon, AirBnB's presence has reached epic proportions.

We can see Lisbon tops the chart in number of listings by citizen. Of Also 80% of listings are for entire apartments and 77% are available for more than 3 months. So much for that extra couch in the living room or the occasional weekend away.

This really looks like a sustainable process doesn't it?



The people that used to live in the city can tell you what the impact has been on rent prices. A lot of them find themselves across the river.

Recently government took [some steps](https://eco.sapo.pt/2019/10/23/lisboa-trava-novos-alojamentos-locais-na-baixa-avenida-da-liberdade-e-almirante-reis/) in an attempt to flatten this particular curve. They've defined radioactive-like *absolute containment areas* where no more apartments can be registered for short-term stay.


It's not all bad. To connect this project with one of my previous posts, the fact of the matter is that many old, rotten buildings in historical areas have been rehabilitated. Here for example we can see the number of construction permits issued rising as the number of AirBnBs also increase. We can't deny that our city is looking sharp. The only problem is we can't afford it.

I'm not saying there is causality between the correlations... you would need an experiment to test that.. like for example removing all tourists from a city. Guess what a pandemic is kind of a natural experiment. Now we don't have new officil data for rents... but it's looking like they're on sale.
