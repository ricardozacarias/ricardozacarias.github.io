TLDR: I analyzed AirBnB data in Lisbon, its impact on the housing market and the dramatic effect the COVID-19 quarantine had on 

<h1 id="posts-label"></h1>

Isn't it funny how we all love to travel but hate tourists? 

The explosion in tourism in Portugal and its role in economic recovery has been documented... extensively. As such it is beyond the scope of this article. Instead, much like a hypochondriac reading every word in the leaflet of a prescription drug, I'm more interested in the side effects. 

AirBnB started as an 'original' idea of two roommates placing an extra mattress in the living room. Otherwise known as monetizing couch surfing (which started way back in 2003). As it grew in popularity, ambition quickly followed and they have now achieved 'disruption' of much more than the hotel industry. In the case of Lisbon, the number of AirBnB have reached epic proportions.

We can see Lisbon tops the chart in number of listings by citizen. Also 80% of listings are for entire apartments and 77% are available for more than 3 months. So much for that extra couch in the living room or the occasional weekend away. 

Another way to visualize it is in a map (of course).
